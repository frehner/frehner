### Hello!

I'm Anthony Frehner, a frontend web developer and architect. I like to contribute to open source when I have the time, and I'm currently providing feedback for a new [WICG proposal](https://github.com/WICG/app-history) for which I'm also creating a [polyfill](https://github.com/frehner/appHistory).

I am also a core-team member of the [`single-spa`](https://single-spa.js.org) open source library, I occasionally give conference talks - here's my talk at [React Rally 2019](https://youtu.be/RgqSlRbbvwA) - and [write technical articles.](https://dev.to/frehner), and I proposed the [`vhc`](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4329) CSS unit.

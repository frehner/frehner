### Hello!

I'm Anthony Frehner, a frontend web developer and architect. I'm currently working at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/).

I love working in open source and on web standards/specs. Some contributions are:
- Proposed what eventually became the new CSS [dvh, lvh, svh](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4329) units
- Implemented the majority of the [TC39 test262 tests for the `Set.union` method](https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3816)
- Wrote [The Modern Guide to Packaging Your JavaScript Library](https://github.com/frehner/modern-guide-to-packaging-js-library)
- Provided feedback on the [Navigation API](https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api)
- Was a core contributor to [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org)

I also like to write articles, and occasionally I give talks. For example I:
- Wrote an article on the [`dvh`, `lvh`, and `svh`](https://dev.to/frehner/css-vh-dvh-lvh-svh-and-vw-units-27k4) units
- Spoke at [React Rally 2019](https://youtu.be/RgqSlRbbvwA)
- Detailed how to [compose JavaScript decorators](https://dev.to/frehner/composing-javascript-decorators-2o38) with the new syntax

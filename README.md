### Hello!

I'm Anthony Frehner, a frontend web developer and architect. I like to contribute to open source when I have the time, and I'm currently working on a polyfill for a new WICG proposal. I am also a core-team member of the `single-spa` open source library, and I occasionally give conference talks (for example, I spoke at React Rally 2019).

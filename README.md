### Hello!

I'm Anthony Frehner, a frontend web developer and architect. I like to contribute to open source when I have the time, and I'm currently working on a [polyfill](https://github.com/frehner/appHistory) for a new [WICG proposal](https://github.com/WICG/app-history). I am also a core-team member of the [`single-spa`](single-spa.js.org) open source library, I occasionally give conference talks (for example, [React Rally 2019](https://youtu.be/RgqSlRbbvwA)), and I proposed the [`vhc`](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4329) CSS unit.

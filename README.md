### Hello!

I'm Anthony Frehner, a frontend web developer and architect. I like to contribute to open source when I have the time! I'm currently working on [Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/) ðŸ™‚

I've recently been providing feedback on a [WICG proposal](https://github.com/WICG/app-history) for which I also spent some time making a [polyfill](https://github.com/frehner/appHistory). I am a core-team member of the [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org) open source library, I occasionally give conference talks - here's my talk at [React Rally 2019](https://youtu.be/RgqSlRbbvwA) - and [write technical articles](https://dev.to/frehner), and I proposed a new CSS unit called [vhc](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4329) which eventually turned into the [`dvh`, `lvh`, and `svh`](https://dev.to/frehner/css-vh-dvh-lvh-svh-and-vw-units-27k4) (and equivalent `*vw`) CSS units, which was [very exciting](https://twitter.com/frehner_a/status/1405915191582380041) for me personally!
